    switch read as low on turbine board
        sent to load
        load flips own Relay
        tells turbine to flip relay and Pitch
        turbine flips relay
        turbine pitches

    switch read as high on turbine board
        sent to load
        load tells turbine to pitch to cutin
        * load waits to see enough power on turbine side (might already see it cause pcc is flipped)
        once enough power seen
            load flips own relay
            load
             tells turbine to flip relay
        turbine flips relay

    disconnect sensed on load side
        ** (hope and pray) comms are still live **
        load flips own relay
        load tells turbine to flip relay and pitch
    
    reconnect sensed
        load tells turbine to pitch back
        * load waits to see enough power on turbine side (might already see it cause pcc is flipped)
        once enough power seen
            load flips own relay
            load tells turbine to flip relay
        turbine flips relay

* false power readings due to pcc relay being flipped
** operating on turbine produced power
